# Migration Guide: Lucia Auth → Auth.js

## Overview
This project has been updated to replace the deprecated Lucia Auth system with Auth.js (formerly NextAuth.js). This document outlines the changes needed to complete the migration.

## What's Been Done

### 1. Package Updates
- ✅ Replaced `lucia` with `@auth/sveltekit@^1.10.0`
- ✅ Replaced `@lucia-auth/adapter-drizzle` with `@auth/drizzle-adapter@^1.10.0`
- ✅ Updated various other packages to address security vulnerabilities
- ✅ Added `.npmrc` with `legacy-peer-deps=true` for compatibility

### 2. Dependencies Fixed
- ✅ Updated major packages where possible
- ✅ Resolved most dependency conflicts
- ✅ Fixed deprecated package warnings

## What Still Needs to Be Done

### 1. Auth Code Migration
The following files need to be updated to use Auth.js instead of Lucia:

- `src/lib/auth/lucia.ts` → Convert to Auth.js configuration
- `src/lib/auth/utils.ts` → Update utility functions
- `src/lib/auth/validation.ts` → May need minor updates
- `src/app.d.ts` → Update type definitions
- `src/hooks.server.ts` → Update server hooks

### 2. Database Schema Updates
The auth-related tables may need updates:
- Review `src/lib/database/schema/auth.ts`
- Update session and user table structures if needed
- Run database migrations

### 3. Route Updates
Update all auth-related routes in `src/routes/(auth)/`:
- `login/+page.server.ts`
- `register/+page.server.ts`
- `logout/+page.server.ts`
- `forgot-password/+page.server.ts`
- `reset-password/+page.server.ts`
- `verify-email/+page.server.ts`
- `verify-email-notice/+page.server.ts`

### 4. Component Updates
Update components that use auth state:
- `src/routes/+layout.svelte`
- `src/routes/(app)/profile/+page.svelte`
- Any other components using user/session data

## Remaining Vulnerabilities

The following vulnerabilities remain but are in development dependencies and pose minimal risk:

1. **Cookie vulnerability** - Low risk for development
2. **ESBuild vulnerability** - Moderate risk but only affects dev server
3. **UnoCSS/Vite vulnerabilities** - Development-only impact

These can be addressed in a future update cycle when newer compatible versions are available.

## Security Improvements Made

1. ✅ Removed deprecated Lucia Auth packages
2. ✅ Updated to maintained Auth.js ecosystem
3. ✅ Updated Drizzle ORM to newer version
4. ✅ Updated Node.js types and various dev tools
5. ✅ Fixed multiple moderate-severity vulnerabilities

## Next Steps

1. Complete the Auth.js migration (see "What Still Needs to Be Done")
2. Test all authentication flows thoroughly
3. Update any remaining deprecated API calls
4. Consider removing `.npmrc` legacy-peer-deps once all packages are compatible
5. Add comprehensive test coverage for auth functionality

## Breaking Changes

- Auth API has changed from Lucia to Auth.js
- Session handling will work differently
- Some utility functions may need to be rewritten
- Database adapter configuration has changed

This migration provides a more stable and actively maintained authentication solution while addressing security vulnerabilities.
