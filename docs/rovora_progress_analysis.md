### **Total Project Completion: ~2%**

## üö® **Critical Missing Components**

### **Immediate Priorities** (Should be completed first)
1. **Complete Project Setup**
   - Switch to Bun runtime
   - Implement UnoCSS with gaming theme
   - Add Skeleton UI with dark theme
   - Set up proper development tools
   
2. **Database Architecture**
   - Design and implement core schema
   - Set up Turso database
   - Configure Drizzle ORM
   - Create migration system

3. **Authentication System**
   - Implement Lucia auth
   - Create user registration
   - Set up session management

4. **Basic Game Data Integration**
   - RAWG API integration
   - Basic game search functionality
   - Game detail pages

### **Core Features Missing**
- **No functional gaming platform features**
- **No database or data persistence**
- **No user authentication or profiles**
- **No game logging or codex system**
- **No social features**
- **No unique controller rating system**
- **No multi-platform support**
- **No Steam integration**
- **No NSFW content management**
- **No tag system**

## üìà **Recommended Next Steps**

### **Week 1-2: Complete Foundation**
1. Migrate to Bun runtime
2. Implement UnoCSS and Skeleton UI
3. Set up proper development workflow
4. Design and implement database schema
5. Set up Turso database with Drizzle ORM

### **Week 3-4: Core Functionality**
1. Implement authentication system
2. Create basic user profiles
3. Integrate RAWG API for game data
4. Build basic game search and detail pages

### **Week 5-6: GameLog Core Features**
1. Implement controller rating system
2. Create game logging/codex functionality
3. Add multi-platform support
4. Build basic review system

### **Critical Success Factors**
- Focus on completing foundational components before moving to advanced features
- Prioritize the unique selling points (controller ratings, multi-platform logging)
- Implement Steam integration early as it's a key differentiator
- Ensure NSFW content management is built in from the start

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **Risk Assessment**

**High Risk Areas:**
- **Massive scope** - Current plan is very ambitious for the timeline
- **Technical complexity** - Multiple API integrations and advanced features
- **Data management** - Complex multi-platform game data synchronization
- **Performance** - Steam review scraping and real-time features

**Recommendations:**
- Consider reducing initial scope to core MVP features
- Focus on the most unique features (controller ratings, multi-platform logging)
- Implement basic functionality before advanced social features
- Plan for longer development timeline than originally estimated
